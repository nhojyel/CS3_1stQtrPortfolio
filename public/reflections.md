# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

1. **Arithmetic Operators** - These operators are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming, and we use them in JavaScript like we did not just in C++ last year but also in Python during CS1. They include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), divison (/), and modulus (%). Since we  already had prior knowledge about these from my past 2 years in Pisay, learning them in JS was easier because they almost function the same way. Most of our coding tasks rely on arithmetic operators, so we got plenty of practice to understand them deeply. This topic really is the foundation of many programs we write.

2. **Logical Operators** - Logical operators are another important concept that we learned in JavaScript, these operators, such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!) are used to combine or reverse conditions in decision-making statements. I had already worked with these before and they were very useful in solving coding tasks and where one or more conditions needs to be tested, like making a prime or composite number and generator and like the Kaprekar's Constant generator back in CS2. Seeing them again in JS, I quickly understood that they worked the same way. Just like arithmetic operators, they are also similar to what we studied in C++, which made them easier to apply in practice or graded exercises. 

3. **Control Structures** - Control structures like if, else if, and else were concepts I already mastered before our discussion, as I was curious to how it worked differently in JS than C++, and they weren't any major differences in syntax is what I've concured, making this just prior knowledge like the others. In CS2, I had used them many times to make programs respond to different situations and to learn about the difference types of programming paradigms, like modular, structural, and procedural. I also knew how to use switch statements beforehand, which are helpful when checking multiple possible values/instances (cases) of a single variable instead of typing many if-else blocks, the main reason why I also know switch statements well is that I reviewed on how to them beforehand as it was fascinating. Overall, since I was already familiar with combining these structures mainly with the operators mentioned above, I did not need much time to adjust. That is why I was already comfortable with this topic. 

4. **Variable Declaration** - The different ways of declaring variables was something that can be easily picked up. One of the main reasons why is that JavaScript is a straightforward programming language because its syntax is not overly complicated and many of its rules are very easy to pick up. In C++, I was already familar with declaring variable types such as int float or string so I had the basic idea of how variables work. What was new to me is declaring a variable changes its behaviour. I learned that var is the older way of declaring variables and has function scope, while let is a block-scoped and can't be redeclared but is convenient as it can be reassigned, making it mainly the standard. Meanwhile, I already know the parameters and how const works during my time with Sir Javi. Even though this is new, relating it to what I already knew in CS2 made the lesson much easier to understand. 

5. **Control Loops** - Control loops were also something I was already confident with even before we studied them in JS. I had plenty of experience in C++ writing for, while, and do-while loops, so repeating code with conditions was nothing new to me. I knew how to use them to generate sequences, process data, and solve problems where tasks had to be repeated. Since JavaScript loops follow the same logic, it was easy to apply what I already knew, except that instead of just assigning a value like int i = 1, I quickly learned that we always use let to declare variables. This lesson was really refreshing and made me reminisce about memories from Grade 8. 

> so basically what makes it easy for me to learn is that these lessons are: JS == C++ .

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **Applying Nested Loops** - Nested loops are loops inside another loop, where the outer loop controls how many times the inner loop runs. They are often used for tasks such as handling grids, tables, or multi-dimensional array is what I learned in CS2. While I understand the concept, applying them in like generating a asterisk triangle or some advanced problems can be confusing for me because both loop counters must be managed carefully. I sometimes struggle with avoiding off-by-one errors or infinite loops, especially when working with multiple nested structures. That is why I need more practic to fully master applying loops in real coding tasks.

2. **Break and Continue Statements** - The break statement is used to immediately exit a loop, while the continue statement skips the current iteration and moves directly to the next cycle. These are helpful for controlling the flow of loops without finishing all the iterations. However, I sometimes get confused about how these statements behave in maybe nested loops. For example, I might forget which loop is being exited or skipped when multiple loops are present. There are a lack of application of such for these statements in our discussions which is why it would be interesting if they were discussed as these seem like very valuable, other than in switch statements which I've noticed.    

3. **Difference between two methods in declaring functions** - In JS, functions can be created either through a declaration or an expression. Functiond declarations can be hoisted meaning it can be called before it is written in the code, while a function expression cannot. I already understand this difference, but I need more practice to apply it correctly in different coding situations. We barely tapped into the topics of functions as a while so I was kinda confused in the exams on why they were functions even though I don't remember learning it alot.

4. **Logical Operators** - Logical operators are used to combine or negate conditions in programming. For boolean values, && returns true if only both operands are true, and || returns true if one of the operants are true is what I've previously learned. In the activity one time we did in class, to guess which gets outputed, it confused me but it was fun! They can also return non-boolean values which confuses me. For example cat && dog returns dog while cat || dog returns cat. The main problem I face is remembering which operands gets returned, especially when mixing non-boolean values, so I need a clearer explanation as to why such happens. 

5. **Assignment Operators** - These are used to assign values to variables, and shorthand forms like += and -= can make code shorter and easier to read. While I understand the basic use of them, I sometimes make mistakes when combining assignment with other operations in larger programs. For example, I may forget how the value updates step by step, which can lead to logical errors. Another issue I face is that when assignment operators are placed inside larger expressions, can make the flow of updates hard to take track off when analyzing code. 

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. I will practice nested loops in simple exercises like printing patterns, handling 2D arrays, and printing figures. Then I'll gradually move on to solving harder problems that require multiple layers of looping. By doing this step-by-step, I can get used to tracking loop counters without confusion

2. I will try coding small examples like in the learning guides that use break and continue in different control structures and especially loop types as I want to challenge myself. After that I'll test them in my most hated topic, nested loops, to clearly how they really affect the flow. This will help me avoid mistakes in choosing which loops gets affected.

3. I will review examples of both declaration and expressions and note when each is best used. Then I'll practice rewriting functions in both forms to understand the difference. I will also attend consults as I've never really tried joining them. This will help me get comfortable and know which one to use for a certain situation like the different variable declarations. 

4. I will experiment with logical operators by testing them with both boolean and non-boolean values. Then I'll practice writing complex conditions and predict what the output should be before running them, like im doing this as a game. This will really train me to better understand the return values.

5. I will practice solving coding problems that use assignment operators in different ways. Then I'll break down each step of how variable updates to avoid confusion as mentioned earlier. This is not really a massive problem as it is similar to incrementing, but I'm a careless guy and I want to make sure I know how to do stuff properly.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

* **Hands-on Coding Practice Exercises** - These were effective because they allowed me to directly apply what we just learned. It was like commiting a file to link to github, the memory just saves. Writing the code made me feel  more confident, and I was able to quickly see which parts I understood, and which needed more review or consultation on.

* **Group Coding Challenges** - Working with our triads or classmates in general, helped me learn different approaches to the same problem. It was effective because we explained our thought processes. This really concepts more deeply.

# Not Effective Activites

* **Pure Lecture Sessions** - While the lectures provided information, they were not as effective for me since I learn better by doing. Plus, our generation with all the brainrot and stuff, makes our attention span so little, and hard not to sleep in class. Just listening without applying concepts right away makes it harder to retain. 

* **Copying Code Without Explanation** - Sometimes we were given code to copy and run, but without breaking down why it worked. This activity was not very effective because I could run the program, but I did not fully understand the logic behind it. But coding on my own and researching about stuff is way better.
